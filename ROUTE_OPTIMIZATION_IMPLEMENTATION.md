```typescript
const routeRequest = {
  origin: {
    id: 'uc_baguio',
    name: 'University of the Cordilleras',
    lat: 16.4067,
    lng: 120.5960
  },
  destination: {
    id: 'newtown_plaza',
    name: 'New Town Plaza Hotel Baguio',
    lat: 16.4099,
    lng: 120.5950
  },
  preferences: {
    routeType: 'fastest',
    avoidTrafficJams: true
  }
};
```

### Quick Routes

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- **Route Data**: 5-minute cache for calculated routes
- **Traffic Data**: 2-minute cache for traffic analysis
- **Location Search**: 1-hour cache for geocoding results

### Real-time Efficiency
- **Update Intervals**: 2-minute intervals for traffic monitoring
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple API calls processed in parallel
- **Smart Throttling**: Reduces API calls during low-change periods

## üîê Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- TomTom API keys are server-side only
- No sensitive data exposed to client
- Rate limiting implemented

### Input Validation
- All API endpoints validate input parameters
- Location coordinates bounds checking
- Route request sanitization

## üêõ Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Fallback traffic data when API unavailable
- Mock route visualization during development
- User-friendly error messages

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Alternative data sources when primary fails
- Cache fallback for offline scenarios
