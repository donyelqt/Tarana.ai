- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`npm run lint`)

### **Environment Variables** (Vercel Dashboard)
Navigate to: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` = `https://your-production-domain.vercel.app`
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` = (your secret - must be set)

---

## **Deployment** üöÄ

### **Option 1: Auto-Deploy from GitHub**
- [ ] Push latest commit to main branch
- [ ] Verify Vercel auto-deploy started
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress in Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete (~2-5 min)

### **Option 2: Manual Deploy**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if needed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Confirm deployment
# Visit: https://vercel.com/[your-team]/[project]/deployments
```

---

## **Post-Deployment Verification** ‚úÖ

### **1. Basic Health Check**
- [ ] Production site loads successfully
- [ ] Can log in with NextAuth
- [ ] Can view saved itineraries
- [ ] No console errors on page load

### **2. Refresh Button - Evaluation Flow**
Navigate to: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/saved-trips/[itinerary-id]`

- [ ] "Smart Refresh" button is visible
- [ ] Click button - no immediate errors
- [ ] Toast notification appears ("Analyzing Changes" or "Already Optimized")
- [ ] Check browser console for logs:
  ```
  ‚úÖ Should see: "üîÑ Changes detected..." or "‚è≠Ô∏è No changes needed"
  ‚ùå Should NOT see: "404 Not Found" or "Connection Error"
  ```

### **3. Refresh Button - Full Refresh Flow**
- [ ] Click "Smart Refresh" on outdated itinerary
- [ ] Toast shows "Analyzing Changes" ‚Üí "Updating with live data..."
- [ ] Wait 10-20 seconds
- [ ] Toast shows "‚úÖ Refresh Complete" ‚Üí "Optimized with live data"
- [ ] Itinerary UI updates with new activities
- [ ] No error toast appears

### **4. Vercel Logs Verification**
Go to: Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Logs

Filter by: `/api/saved-itineraries`

- [ ] See logs: `üîÑ ITINERARY REFRESH REQUEST - ID: ...`
- [ ] See logs: `üì° Calling generation API: https://...`
- [ ] See logs: `‚úÖ Itinerary generated successfully`
- [ ] See logs: `‚úÖ REFRESH COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - Duration: ...ms`
- [ ] **No** timeout errors (FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT)
- [ ] **No** 404 errors
- [ ] Response time: <60s

### **5. Database Verification**
Open Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check refresh metadata was updated
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  "refreshMetadata"->>'lastRefreshedAt' as last_refresh,
  "refreshMetadata"->>'refreshCount' as count,
  "refreshMetadata"->>'status' as status
FROM saved_itineraries
WHERE id = 'your-test-itinerary-id'
ORDER BY "refreshMetadata"->>'lastRefreshedAt' DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Expected results:
- [ ] `last_refresh` shows recent timestamp
- [ ] `count` incremented by 1
- [ ] `status` = 'REFRESH_COMPLETED'

---

## **Error Scenarios Testing** üß™

### **Test 1: Network Timeout**
**Expected**: Graceful timeout handling after 60s

- [ ] Trigger refresh on complex itinerary
- [ ] If takes >60s, should see: "Request Timeout - Taking too long"
- [ ] Button re-enables after timeout
- [ ] Can retry refresh

### **Test 2: Invalid API Key**
**Expected**: Proper error message

- [ ] Temporarily set wrong API key in Vercel
- [ ] Trigger refresh
- [ ] Should see: "Update Failed" with error details
- [ ] Check logs for specific error (e.g., "Invalid API key")

### **Test 3: No Changes Needed**
**Expected**: Skip regeneration

- [ ] Refresh recently updated itinerary
- [ ] Should see: "‚ö° Already Optimized - No changes needed"
- [ ] No API call to generation endpoint
- [ ] Response <2s

---

## **Performance Benchmarks** üìä

Run multiple refresh operations and verify:

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Evaluation time | <2s | ___s | [ ] |
| Generation time | 8-15s | ___s | [ ] |
| Total refresh time | <20s | ___s | [ ] |
| Success rate | >95% | __% | [ ] |
| Timeout rate | <2% | __% | [ ] |
| Error rate | <5% | __% | [ ] |

---
