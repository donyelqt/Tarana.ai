## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

1. **Client (Next.js App Router)**  
   ‚Ä¢ React 19 components rendered on the edge or client.  
   ‚Ä¢ Tailwind CSS + Radix UI/shadcn for styling and headless components.  
   ‚Ä¢ Auth context provided by **NextAuth.js** via `components/providers/SessionProvider.tsx`.  

2. **API Routes (Next.js)**  
   ‚Ä¢ `/api/gemini` ‚Äì Generates itineraries.  
   ‚Ä¢ `/api/weather` ‚Äì Weather proxy.  
   ‚Ä¢ `/api/auth/*` ‚Äì Credential / OAuth flow.  
   ‚Ä¢ `/api/reindex` ‚Äì Secure endpoint that triggers embedding (vector-DB) re-indexing.  

3. **Embedding & Vector Storage**  
   ‚Ä¢ Script `scripts/indexSampleItinerary.ts` calls `upsertActivityEmbedding` ‚Üí Gemini embedding ‚Üí Supabase `activities` table with a `vector` column (`pgvector`).  
   ‚Ä¢ Runtime similarity search is handled by `src/lib/vectorSearch.ts` which wraps Supabase RPC queries.  

4. **Database (Supabase / Postgres)**  
   ‚Ä¢ Schema and migrations live in `supabase/migrations/*` (RLS, pgvector, extra columns).  
   ‚Ä¢ Row-level security enabled; service role used by backend scripts.  

5. **Authentication**  
   ‚Ä¢ NextAuth.js sessions persisted via Supabase.  
   ‚Ä¢ Passwords hashed with `bcryptjs`.  

6. **Deployment**  
   ‚Ä¢ Front/Back deployed on Vercel.  
   ‚Ä¢ Database managed by Supabase.

## ü§ù Contributing Guidelines

We're excited to have you contribute! To ensure a smooth and collaborative process, please follow these guidelines.

#### Development Workflow
1.  **Pick an issue**: Assign yourself to an existing issue or create a new one to discuss your proposed changes.
2.  **Create a branch**: Create a new branch from `main` using the following naming convention:
    -   `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/12-add-user-profile-page`)
    -   `fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>` (e.g., `fix/15-fix-login-button-bug`)
3.  **Code**: Make your changes, following the project's code style.
4.  **Commit**: Use Conventional Commits for your commit messages (see below).
5.  **Lint**: Run the linter before pushing:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
6.  **Push**: Push your branch to the repository.
7.  **Create a Pull Request**: Open a PR from your branch to `main` and link it to the relevant issue.

#### Commit Message Convention
We use [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to keep our commit history clean and readable. Each commit message should follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

-   **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`.
-   **Scope** (optional): The part of the codebase you're changing (e.g., `auth`, `itinerary`, `ui`).

**Example:**
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

Users can now request a password reset from the sign-in page. This adds the necessary API endpoint and UI components.

Resolves: #23
```

#### Pull Request Process
1.  **Create a PR**: Open a pull request from your feature/fix branch to the `main` branch.
2.  **Write a clear description**:
    -   Provide a concise summary of the changes.
    -   Explain the "why" behind your changes.
    -   Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.
    -   Link the PR to the issue it resolves (e.g., "Closes #12").
3.  **Request a review**: Assign at least one team member to review your PR.
4.  **Address feedback**: Make any necessary changes based on the feedback.
5.  **Merge**: Once approved, your PR will be squashed and merged into `main`.

#### Code Style
-   We use **ESLint** for linting and **Prettier** for code formatting.
-   Run `npm run lint` to check for and fix issues.
-   Follow the existing conventions in the codebase for consistency.

## Vector Search & Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This project uses **Supabase Postgres + pgvector** to provide semantic retrieval for Gemini prompts.

### Prerequisites

1. Environment variables

```
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key   # server-side only
REINDEX_SECRET=some-long-random-string            # protects /api/reindex
```

2. Enable pgvector & create schema

```
supabase db push            # or run SQL in supabase/migrations/20240730000000_add_itinerary_embeddings_pgvector.sql
```

### Index existing activities

```bash
npm run index-embeddings     # generates embeddings for sample itinerary and upserts to Supabase
```

Or deploy and call the secured endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<deployment>/api/reindex \
     -H "X-ADMIN-TOKEN: $REINDEX_SECRET"
```

### Running similarity search locally

```ts
import { searchSimilarActivities } from "@/lib/vectorSearch";
const results = await searchSimilarActivities("budget-friendly food", 10);
```

### Adding or updating activities

1. Edit the seed file at `src/app/itinerary-generator/components/itineraryData.ts` (or create new JSON files under `scripts/data/`).
2. Run `npm run index-embeddings` again. The script will:
   - Generate embeddings for each activity using Gemini.
   - Upsert each row into Supabase‚Äôs `activities` table (existing `activity_id`s are updated; new ones are inserted).
3. Confirm the changes in Supabase (dashboard or SQL query).

The application now reads exclusively from the vector database; the seed file remains a version-controlled source of truth for local development and CI.

### Tests

```
npm test   # runs Jest + ts-jest unit tests for embeddings and vector search
```
