## ü§ù Contributing Guidelines

We're excited to have you contribute! To ensure a smooth and collaborative process, please follow these guidelines.

#### Development Workflow
1.  **Pick an issue**: Assign yourself to an existing issue or create a new one to discuss your proposed changes.
2.  **Create a branch**: Create a new branch from `main` using the following naming convention:
    -   `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/12-add-user-profile-page`)
    -   `fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>` (e.g., `fix/15-fix-login-button-bug`)
3.  **Code**: Make your changes, following the project's code style.
4.  **Commit**: Use Conventional Commits for your commit messages (see below).
5.  **Lint**: Run the linter before pushing:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
6.  **Push**: Push your branch to the repository.
7.  **Create a Pull Request**: Open a PR from your branch to `main` and link it to the relevant issue.

#### Commit Message Convention
We use [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to keep our commit history clean and readable. Each commit message should follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

-   **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`.
-   **Scope** (optional): The part of the codebase you're changing (e.g., `auth`, `itinerary`, `ui`).

**Example:**
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

Users can now request a password reset from the sign-in page. This adds the necessary API endpoint and UI components.

Resolves: #23
```

#### Pull Request Process
1.  **Create a PR**: Open a pull request from your feature/fix branch to the `main` branch.
2.  **Write a clear description**:
    -   Provide a concise summary of the changes.
    -   Explain the "why" behind your changes.
    -   Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.
    -   Link the PR to the issue it resolves (e.g., "Closes #12").
3.  **Request a review**: Assign at least one team member to review your PR.
4.  **Address feedback**: Make any necessary changes based on the feedback.
5.  **Merge**: Once approved, your PR will be squashed and merged into `main`.

#### Code Style
-   We use **ESLint** for linting and **Prettier** for code formatting.
-   Run `npm run lint` to check for and fix issues.
-   Follow the existing conventions in the codebase for consistency.

#### Reporting Bugs
-   Use the **"Bug Report"** issue template on GitHub.
