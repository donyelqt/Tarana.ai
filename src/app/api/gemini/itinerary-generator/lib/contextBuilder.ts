      Generate a detailed Baguio City itinerary using the semantically retrieved activities from the database. For multi-day itineraries, ensure each activity is only recommended once across all days.

      Rules:
      1. **Be precise and personalized.**
      2. **MANDATORY: ONLY use activities from the provided RAG database that also exist in our canonical activity list.** You are FORBIDDEN from creating, inventing, or suggesting ANY activity that is not explicitly listed in both the RAG database and our canonical data. Every single activity in your response MUST have an exact title match in our canonical data. The system will automatically provide the correct image URLs from our local imports - do not modify image URLs. If the database is empty or insufficient, return fewer activities rather than inventing new ones.
      3. **Prioritize activities with higher relevanceScore values** as they are more closely aligned with the user's query, interests, weather conditions, and current traffic levels. Activities with real-time traffic data should be prioritized over those with only peak hours data.
      4. Organize by Morning (8AM-12NN), Afternoon (12NN-6PM), Evening (6PM onwards), respecting the time periods already suggested in the database.
      ${durationDays ? `4.a. Ensure the itinerary spans exactly ${durationDays} day(s). Create separate day sections and, within each day, include Morning, Afternoon, and Evening periods populated only from the database.` : ""}
      5. Pace the itinerary based on trip duration, ensuring a balanced schedule.
      6. For each activity, include: **image** (MUST be the exact image URL from the database - do not modify or substitute), **title** (exact title from the database), **time** slot (e.g., "9:00-10:30AM"), a **brief** description that mentions optimal visit times to avoid crowds, and **tags** (exact tags from the database).
      7. **ENHANCED TRAFFIC-AWARE DESCRIPTIONS:** Every activity description MUST include comprehensive traffic timing information combining both peak hours and real-time data. Examples: "Currently LOW traffic (85% optimal) - perfect time to visit!" or "MODERATE traffic expected, best visited after 3 PM when conditions improve." For activities with real-time data, include the traffic level and recommendation score. For peak-hours-only activities, mention the optimal timing based on historical data.
      8. Adhere to the user's budget preferences by selecting only activities from the database that match the budget category.
      9. **CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT activities across different days.** Each activity should only be recommended once in the entire itinerary.
      10. **ENHANCED VALIDATION REQUIREMENT:** Before including any activity, verify it exists in the provided database AND meets traffic criteria: not in peak hours AND not marked as 'AVOID_NOW' for real-time traffic. Prioritize activities with 'VISIT_NOW' or 'VISIT_SOON' recommendations. The database combines peak hours filtering with real-time traffic analysis. If insufficient optimal activities exist, return a shorter itinerary rather than including high-traffic activities.
      11. **OUTPUT FORMAT:** Return a JSON object that strictly follows this Zod schema:\n          \`z.object({\n            title: z.string(),\n            subtitle: z.string(),\n            items: z.array(z.object({\n              period: z.string(),\n              activities: z.array(z.object({\n                image: z.string(),\n                title: z.string(),\n                time: z.string(),\n                desc: z.string(),\n                tags: z.array(z.string()),
              })),
            })),\n          })\`
      12. **FINAL CHECK:** Before outputting, verify every single activity title, image URL, and tags match exactly with the provided database entries. Each image field must contain the exact URL string from the database without any modifications.
