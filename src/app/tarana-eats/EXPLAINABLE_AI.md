# 🧠 Explainable AI - Food Recommendations

## 📊 **Overview**

This system implements **Explainable AI (XAI)** principles to ensure users understand WHY each restaurant was recommended. Transparency builds trust and helps users make informed decisions.

---

## 🎯 **Explainability Principles**

### **1. Transparency**
Every recommendation includes:
- ✅ **Why** the restaurant matches their preferences
- ✅ **What** specific dishes are recommended
- ✅ **How** their budget is allocated
- ✅ **Score** showing match confidence

### **2. Actionability**
Users receive:
- ✅ Specific menu items with prices
- ✅ Budget breakdown
- ✅ Number of items selected
- ✅ Utilization percentage

### **3. Trustworthiness**
System shows:
- ✅ Scoring methodology
- ✅ Match criteria used
- ✅ Budget optimization logic
- ✅ Data-driven decisions

---

## 🔍 **Reasoning Structure**

### **Enhanced AI Prompt Instructions**

The system instructs Gemini to provide:

```typescript
DETAILED, TRANSPARENT reasons using this structure:
- Why this restaurant matches (cuisine, dietary options, atmosphere)
- Specific recommended dishes from their menu with prices
- Budget breakdown showing value for money
- Any special features or unique offerings
```

**Example AI Response Format:**
```
DETAILED EXPLANATION: Perfect vegan options available + 
Recommended dishes: [Tofu Sisig (PHP 120), Mushroom Adobo (PHP 150)] + 
Budget fit: [85% utilization] + 
Special notes: [Indoor seating, Cozy ambiance]
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. AI Enhancement Layer**

```typescript
// Enhance AI reasoning with specific allocation details
const topItems = allocation.selectedItems.slice(0, 3);
const itemsDetail = topItems.length > 0 
  ? ` | ✓ Top picks: ${topItems.map(i => `${i.name} (PHP ${i.price})`).join(', ')}`
  : '';
const budgetDetail = ` | ✓ Smart allocation: ${Math.round(allocation.utilizationRate)}% of budget (${allocation.selectedItems.length} items, PHP ${allocation.totalCost.toLocaleString()})`;

const enhancedReason = match.reason + itemsDetail + budgetDetail;
```

### **2. Intelligent Reasoning Builder**

```typescript
const detailedReason = [
  `✓ Match: ${rec.matchReasons.join(', ')}`,
  `✓ Recommended: ${itemsText}`,
  `✓ Budget: ${utilizationPercent}% utilized (PHP ${allocation.totalCost.toLocaleString()} of PHP ${finalPrice.toLocaleString()})`,
  `✓ Score: ${Math.round(rec.score)}/100 based on ${preferences.pax || 2} people`,
  allocation.selectedItems.length > 0 ? `✓ ${allocation.selectedItems.length} items selected for variety` : ''
].filter(Boolean).join(' | ');
```
